# Introduction

Computing power has advanced by tremendous leaps and bounds
over the past few decades.  What once would have required
multi-million super computers crafted of the genius of
Cray are now available, on the desktop, for but a few
hundred dollars.  Or even less using commodity services
such as Amazon AWS or Google Compute Cloud.

It is time to seize this power and apply it to games!

Play every move.  Employ exhaustive searches.  Let CPU
cycles fall from the heavens - gather them, burn them,
and rejoice.

This is the GitHub repository for **Brute Force Game Tech**!
